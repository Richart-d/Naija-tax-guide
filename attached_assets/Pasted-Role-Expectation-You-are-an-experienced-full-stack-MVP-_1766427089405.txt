Role & Expectation

You are an experienced full-stack MVP engineer and product builder.
Your task is to design and build a functional MVP web application for a Nigerian Tax-Readiness Product, using simple, beginner-friendly architecture that works reliably on Replit Free Tier.

This is not a production system.
It is a mentor-reviewable MVP demo focused on clarity, usability, and correctness — not scale, automation, or integrations.

1. Project Overview

Build a Nigerian Tax-Readiness Web App designed to help:

Individuals

Freelancers

Salary earners

Self-employed people

Small business owners

understand and prepare for their tax obligations under the 2025/2026 Nigerian tax reforms.

The app must:

Simplify complex tax laws

Explain obligations in plain English

Guide users on what applies to them

Help users become tax-ready, not file taxes

This product fills a clear market gap:
Most Nigerian financial apps focus on banking, invoicing, or bookkeeping, but none provide simple tax clarity for everyday Nigerians.

This MVP should act as a Tax Readiness Companion, not an accounting tool.

2. Core Problem Being Solved

Nigerians currently face:

Tax laws scattered across large, complex documents

Low awareness of which taxes apply to them

High risk of penalties due to misunderstanding

No simple digital tool for tax education without accounting knowledge

This MVP addresses tax confusion and lack of clarity, nothing more.

3. Project Objectives (MVP Scope)

The MVP must:

Help users identify which taxes apply to them

Explain relevant tax rules in simple, non-technical language

Provide a step-by-step tax readiness guide

Be lightweight, fast, and easy to use

Require no login

Optionally include a basic Tax Assistant Chatbot

4. Target Users
Primary Users

Freelancers & gig workers

Self-employed individuals

Digital workers (content creators, POS agents, artisans, riders)

Salary earners unsure of tax deductions

Secondary Users (future expansion)

Nano and small businesses (SMEs)

Important:
These users need clarity and guidance, not bookkeeping or tax filing automation.

5. MVP Features (Must Build)
A. Tax Category Understanding

Static guides explaining:

Personal Income Tax (PIT)

VAT (basic understanding)

Withholding tax (high-level)

Local/state levies (high-level)

B. Tax Obligations Classifier

A 4–6 question questionnaire that asks:

User type

Income category

Location (state relevance)

Work type (salary, freelance, business)

Output:

A Tax Responsibility Summary showing applicable taxes

No data storage required.

C. Tax Self-Assessment Questionnaire

Simple Yes/No & multiple-choice questions

Gives a readiness hint, not a score

No data saving

D. Learning Modules

Short, digestible content pages:

“What taxes apply to me?”

“How the 2025/2026 reforms affect you”

“Common mistakes to avoid”

E. Tax-Ready Checklist

Dynamic checklist based on user answers

Shows documents & steps to prepare

Printable or copyable

F. Personalized Tax Tips

Simple rule-based logic

Suggests next steps based on answers

G. Optional: Tax Assistant Chatbot

Answers basic questions

Uses static, curated content

No tax filing, calculations, or professional advice

6. Explicitly Out of Scope (DO NOT BUILD)

❌ Bookkeeping
❌ Income/expense tracking
❌ Invoicing
❌ Accounting systems
❌ Receipt uploads
❌ Payroll
❌ Tax filing automation
❌ Payments or remittance
❌ User accounts or dashboards
❌ External APIs (FIRS, banks, etc.)
❌ Mobile app
❌ Cloud databases

This is a tax understanding tool only.

7. Deliverables

Replit AI must produce:

A clean, single-page responsive web app

Functional tax classifier

Self-assessment questionnaire

Learning modules

Tax-ready checklist

Personalized tips

Optional chatbot

Clear code structure

9. Non-Functional Requirements

Beginner-friendly UI

No heavy animations

No mandatory login

10. Assumptions & Constraints

Tax rules are static

Content based on public documents

No backend database

Beginner-level implementation only

11. Success Criteria

The MVP is successful if:

Users understand obligations in under 3 minutes

Classifier correctly handles common cases

Users report clarity

Chatbot answers at least 20 common FAQs

Mentor can clearly see product potential

12. Technical Guidance (Recommended)

Use:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or lightweight React if necessary)

Client-side logic only

JSON for static tax rules

Simple modular structure

No paid services

Final Instruction

Do not over-engineer.
