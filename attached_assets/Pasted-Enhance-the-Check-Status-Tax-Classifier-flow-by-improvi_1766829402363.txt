Enhance the “Check Status / Tax Classifier” flow by improving clarity around income types and adding small, unobtrusive tooltips/info hints to help users understand questions and options without overwhelming the interface.

Do not change the overall app structure or add out-of-scope features.

Required Changes
1. Update Income Classification Flow

Replace the current “Self-Employed vs Business Owner” question with a two-step flow:

Step 1: Primary Work Structure

Ask:

“How do you earn income?”
(Allow multiple selection)

Options:

I earn a salary from an employer

I work for myself alone (freelance, gigs, personal services)

I run a small business that sells goods or services

I run a registered company (LTD)

I do a mix of the above

Add a small tooltip / info icon next to:

The question title

Each option

Tooltip content should briefly explain:

Salary → employer pays you and may deduct PAYE

Work for myself alone → you earn directly from your personal skills or services

Small business → business sells goods/services and may operate beyond just you

Registered company → business is legally separate from you

Mix → more than one income source

Tooltips should be:

Short (1–2 lines)

Optional to read

Visible on hover or tap

Mobile-friendly

2. Add Step 2 (Conditional – Business Complexity)

Only show this step if the user selects:

“I run a small business…”

OR “I do a mix of the above”

Ask:

“Does your business have any of these?”
(Multi-select)

Options:

Staff or helpers

A shop, outlet, or POS terminal

Regular daily sales

Business name or CAC registration

Add a tooltip next to the question explaining:

This helps determine how your activity is treated for tax readiness

It does not mean your business is automatically a company

Add brief tooltips to each option (e.g., staff = anyone you pay to help).

3. Internal Classification Logic (Hidden from User)

Use the answers only for internal logic:

Salary only → Salary Earner (PAYE context)

Works alone → Self-Employed Individual (PIT – self-assessment)

Business + any complexity indicators → Small Business Owner

Mixed income → Mixed Income

Registered company (LTD) → Company Owner (educational scope only)

Do not expose legal tax terms unless explained in plain English.

4. Results Page Update

Explain outcomes in simple, non-technical language

Add a small tooltip or info note where tax terms appear

For LTD owners, show a clear info note:

Companies are taxed differently

This platform provides tax readiness education only

Directors still have personal tax obligations

5. Constraints

No backend

No data storage

No APIs

Client-side only

Modify existing files only

Keep UI clean, mobile-first, and fast

Tooltips should be lightweight (CSS/JS only)

Implement these changes cleanly and ensure the classifier still works instantly.

🔧 Key Improvements

• Reduced confusion without adding visible clutter
• Maintained MVP scope and simplicity
• Improved mobile usability and mentor-readability

🧠 Techniques Applied

Progressive disclosure (tooltips)

Constraint-based prompt optimization

UX clarity without feature creep

💡 Pro Tip

If a user can complete the flow without guessing what a term means, the tooltips are doing their job.
