Task 1: Checklist Page – UI Tweak (Minor Adjustment)

The checklist page is functionally correct, but the income-type dropdown UI needs improvement.

Fix the following:

The dropdown is too transparent

It visually overlaps background text

It lacks clear visual separation

Implement:

Solid background color (white or light neutral)

Proper z-index so it floats above background content

Border + subtle shadow

Adequate padding and margin

Ensure it is fully readable and accessible on all screen sizes

⚠️ Do not change dropdown logic or options — UI styling only.

Task 2: Learn Page – Content Update (Not Yet Implemented)

The Learn page needs new educational sections and content.

A. Add a new Learn option:

Title: Presumptive Tax
Provide a simple explanation suitable for non-technical users.

B. Add a separate Learn section titled:
“Did You Know?”

Inside this section, display the following as expandable cards or accordions (clean, readable, not overwhelming):

Each item should include:

Short title

What it means

Why it matters / key action

Topics to include (use the exact wording below):

Rent Relief – Automatic Money You Never Knew About

Cash Payment Above ₦50,000 = Free Money to Government

Crypto / Dollar Gift or Sales – Tax Man Wants a Cut

Shares “Small Money” Escape Hole

Minimum-Wage Workers Still Must File a Return

PAYE 10% Bonus – Use It or Lose It

Freelancers Paid from Abroad – No WHT, But…

Pension / NHIS / NHF – Free Money Twice
