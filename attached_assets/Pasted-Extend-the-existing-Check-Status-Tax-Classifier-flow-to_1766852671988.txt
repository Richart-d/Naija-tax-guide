Extend the existing “Check Status / Tax Classifier” flow to include non-profit organisations (NGOs, charities, associations, cooperatives, and similar bodies) in a clear, educational, and non-technical way — without adding tax calculations or compliance automation.

Required Changes
1. Extend Primary Income Question

In the question:

“How do you earn income?”

Add a new option:

I run or manage a non-profit / NGO / charity / association

Add a tooltip explaining:

Non-profits may still have tax obligations depending on how they earn income

2. Add NGO Classification Step (Conditional)

Only show this step if the NGO option is selected.

Ask:

“Which best describes your organisation?” (Multi-select)

Options:

Religious or faith-based organisation

Charity or foundation

NGO / non-profit organisation

Cooperative society

Trade union or professional association

Add a tooltip noting:

These labels do not automatically mean tax-free status

3. Add NGO Income-Type Check

Ask:

“Does your organisation receive income from any of these?” (Multi-select)

Options:

Donations, grants, tithes, or gifts

Membership dues or subscriptions

Sale of goods or merchandise

Paid training, consultancy, or events

Rent, licensing, or service fees

Use this only for readiness classification, not calculations.

4. Results Page Update

Display a plain-English summary explaining:

Which income types are commonly exempt

Which income types may be treated as business income

Possible exposure to VAT, WHT, or company income tax

That this platform provides tax readiness education only

Avoid legal citations and technical tax terms unless explained.

5. Constraints

No backend or database

No APIs

Client-side logic only

Modify existing files only

Keep UI simple, mobile-friendly, and fast

Implement changes cleanly and ensure the classifier remains instant and easy to use.

🔧 Key Improvements

• Expanded platform to NGOs without enterprise complexity
• Converted complex tax law into simple income-based logic
• Maintained MVP scope and mentor-review readiness

💡 Pro Tip

If an NGO user finishes the flow and says

“Oh, I didn’t know that part could be taxable”
your feature has succeeded.
